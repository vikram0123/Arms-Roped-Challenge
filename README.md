# Arms-Roped-Challenge
The first series includes analysis at the binary level: participation in binary examination by the
use of IDA Pro and Ghidra tools to understand the architecture and functionalities of the
"arms-roped" binary file. Analysis was conducted at both static and dynamic levels to identify
any vulnerability that might arise.
Tools and Techniques Used:
Ghidra: Utilized for comprehensive binary analysis to understand
its functionalities.
2. Static and Dynamic Analysis Techniques: Applied to identify potential
vulnerabilities within the binary code.
